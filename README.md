This value is calculated annually.


## Business problem:

Nos últimos meses, o time de Analytics percebeu que a taxa de clientes cancelando suas contas e deixando o banco, atingiu números inéditos na empresa. Preocupados com o aumento dessa taxa, o time planejou um plano de ação para diminuir taxa de evasão de clientes.

Preocupados com a queda dessa métrica, o time de Analytics da TopBottom, contratou você como consultor de Data Science para criar um plano de ação, com o objetivo de reduzir a evasão de clientes, ou seja, impedir que o cliente cancele seu contrato e não o renove por mais 12 meses. Essa evasão, nas métricas de negócio, é conhecida como Churn.

In recent months, the Analytics team realized that the rate of customers canceling their accounts and leaving the bank, reached unprecedented numbers in the company. Concerned about the increase in this rate, the team devised an action plan to reduce the rate of customer evasion.

The TopBottom's Analytics wants an action plan, with the objective of reducing customer evasion,  preventing the customer from canceling his contract and not renew it for another 12 months. This evasion, in business metrics, is known as Churn.


## Results:

### 1 - Current TopBank Churn Rate:
Churn percentage is 20.37% of total customers


### 2 - Model performance:

The model's performance in classifying customers as churn is about 86%.


### 3 - The expected return in terms of revenue:

With 86% being the performance of the Churn forecasting model, actions can be taken, since we would know which clients we should invest in financial incentives. If 70% of these customers renew the contract, the company would profit an estimated 23385487.42 euros.
